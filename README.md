# Maximum-Subsequence-Sum-Project
This program implements at least four different algorithms for solving the â€œMaximum Subsequence Sum'' problem that has been discussed in the class. The program starts by reading a set of integer numbers in one line from a text or ASCII file with the numbers separated by a single comma and the file name specified by the user and provides an easy-to- follow menu to allow the user to run an individual algorithm separately or all four algorithms together in sequence. Then the program displays its maximum subsequence sum and the corresponding elapsed execution time(s) on screen.
